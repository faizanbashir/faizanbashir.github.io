― Albert Einstein

The universe is replete with wonders; maybe the greatest of its wonders lies in humanity. Life is fascinating and beautiful beyond the seemingly random play of chemistry and biology with no creator in visible sight. Humanity postulated theories to explain the why, how, and what of our existence on this planet. The search for meaning and order is a characteristic trait of humans. Humanity is the priceless fruit of a majestic tree in our universe. It may not be the only fruit, but at least the one we know.

The CMB(Cosmic Microwave Background) dates the age of our universe at 13.8 billion years old since its inception in the Big Bang. The universe progressed from the Big Bang singularity to the rapid expansion caused by quantum fluctuations until the furnace of the first stars ignited with a blaze of piercing light, illuminating the dark universe. The ancient stars were born from dust and gases from the Big Bang expansion. The inferno within the core of the stars became the furnace for the fusion of lighter elements into heavier elements and finally in the tremendous heat produced from supernovae. The lifetimes of billions of stars vanished to constitute the wondrous form we assume today. Everything on Earth, in simple terms, is the remnants of stars, supernovae, and maybe blackholes. The seed for our planet's incredible chemistry and thriving biology originated in the core of stars far more significant than our sun, in the cataclysmic explosions of dying stars. Every atom of our being was millions of degrees celsius hot and passed stage after stage for billions of years, continually transmuting the constituent particles of our being.

I feel compelled to believe that an Eternal and Omnipotent creator planned, created, and executed all this for some purpose far beyond our petty greed to consume and control the world. He fashioned everything to the extent of perfection within the context of the existence of each form. He is the all-knower yet capable enough to appoint overseers to guide everything in existence to the ultimate purpose of creation. As a result, there is an inexplicable unity in all things in the universe. Our existence spun in the web of space and time, messages resonating across the length of our universe in the form of gravitational waves. Nature is the glue that binds the entire universe from the gravitational anomaly of the great attractor (Laniakea Supercluster) to the weak nuclear force.

Nature is a collective conscious force, overlooking the state of the world and its inhabitants. Encompassing all life on Earth, it witnesses good, bad, injustice, and justice in the same manner. It responds to man and his acts, exerting its force when needed. Every age has a new goal to accomplish for the development and empowerment of man as the apex of creation. Thus it is a constant participative force in his career on Earth; it aids man and exerts the necessary power for course correction. It views humanity as a unity and supports it to achieve its destinies for it. It reveals its designs, strength, and purpose to receptive individuals capable of understanding it. 

Understanding and comprehending Nature at an elemental level is God almighty's greatest gift. It senses the void of justice when created and exerts its forces on man. Thus, an individual is born with extraordinary capability, skills, and talents. It scouts the living individuals of the world to be the fitting parents of the individual it chooses to endow, raise, task, and gift to fill the void of injustice. The course of the Chimera's destiny is set in motion by the existence of a Belarathon. It takes extraordinary circumstances to push a lofty character out of its shell to perform its duties and discharge responsibility. Thus, Chimera is an unwitting agent of Nature in the quest for balance and to reach the ultimate goal of humanity. Nature is a force designated by the creative activity of God almighty, an active conscience intervening in the world. The spirit of Nature reveals itself to poets and philosophers, who again are agents of Nature to achieve an objective wrapped either in truth or in error. Nature's revelations are in line with the needs and mood of each era, at the level of perception of humanity at a particular stage in its progression towards the ultimate goal.

Nature is a collective conscious force, overlooking the state of the world and its inhabitants, encompassing all life on Earth.
