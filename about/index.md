I have a knack for seeing the bigger picture in the scheme of things with an ardent love for architecting complex systems. Tech blogger [@freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/faizanbashir/), [@hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/@faizanbashir), and [@DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/faizanbashir). I am edging towards being a specialized generalist. In the past, I have been identified as a T-shaped person.

Apart from exploring the beautiful world we live in, my diverse interests range from higher poetry and philosophy to politics, economics, history, and so on. I am deeply inspired by the illuminated thought of the poet-philosopher Sir Muhammed Iqbal and the imaginative genius of the great German poet-statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
